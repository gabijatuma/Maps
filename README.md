# Word search unsing map containers

This program collects data from a txt file and strores words with information about them.

It creates a file called "rezultatai.txt", which contains information about words that have been used multiple times and shows in what
lines those words were used.

At the end of the result file the results show user links, that have been used in the text. The links have to be in "www.", "https" or 
"http" formats. Otherwise links will not be found and the text will be registered as a word.

This program is made by using maps and vectors.
